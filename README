Cc
--

1. Is a parallel CFD solver with adjoint shape optimization support
2. It uses Tapenade tool for getting the discrete adjoints and does the shape optimization
3. The parallelization is achieved using MPI library
4. Cc -> Cell-centric or CFD-centeric
5. Has multigrid preconditioner for convergence acceleration
6. Supports SA Turbulence model with RANS
7. Has wall function support for RANS

Coding convention
=================

1) Modules start with upper case, e.g, Mesh, FlowEuler
2) Subroutine names are lower case and seperated by undescore (_), e.g., mesh_metrics(...)
3) Parameters begin with an underscore and fully lower case, e.g., _dim, _tri
4) Local variables are all lower case and any integer variable starts with letter i,j,...,n (no underscores)
5) Fortran types start with a lower case and concanitated by caps, e.g, type polyMesh, type crsGraph
6) Subroutines given to Tapenade for differentiation have a trailing "_tapenade"
