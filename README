Coding convention
=================

1) Modules start with upper case, e.g, Mesh, FlowEuler
2) Subroutine names are lower case and seperated by undescore (_), e.g., mesh_metrics(...)
3) Parameters begin with an underscore and fully lower case, e.g., _dim, _tri
4) Local variables are all lower case and any integer variable starts with letter i,j,...,n (no underscores)
5) Fortran types start with a lower case and concanitated by caps, e.g, type polyMesh, type crsGraph
6) Subroutines given to Tapenade for differentiation have a trailing "_tapenade"
